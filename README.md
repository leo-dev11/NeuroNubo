A second brain prototype, using Retrieval Augmented Generation :) <br>
If you want to test the app it's important to have an API KEY. So create an .env file and put the following text:<br>
OPENROUTER_API_KEY= <br>
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
<br>
Remember don't share your API Key :).
